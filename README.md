# Snake-Game
 A simple snake game built using pygame module in python.<br>

 You can use `W` `A` `S` `D` or <button>&uarr;</button> <button>&larr;</button> <button>&darr;</button> <button>&rarr;</button> to move the snake in different directions.
 
 Also there is a <span style="color: orange;"># BUG</span> in the code, which has been commented out. Would like to get help in this issue.

<b>TODO</b><br>
- Define a `pause_game()` method which will pause the game when `SPACE` is pressed.
- Define `restart_game()` method which will restart the game when `ENTER` is pressed.
